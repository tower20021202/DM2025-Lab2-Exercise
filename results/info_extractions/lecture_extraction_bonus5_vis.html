        # LECTURE ANALYSIS: Pending Invitation from NTU Cool
## Video Segment: 10:00

[TRANSCRIPT - 10:14]
So then, if you haven&#x27;t got a NTU cool account, please you also need to have the NTU cool account. We do having a lot of in-class quiz, because you need it to interact with us. Um, we do having a lot of in-class quiz. Don&#x27;t worry, it is not really great you.

[TRANSCRIPT - 10:30]
Okay, so then, try to join NTU cool, just utilize that as participation score.

[TRANSCRIPT - 10:35]
Okay, so then, try to join NTU cool or slido. Today we have some on the slido too.

[TRANSCRIPT - 10:43]
Okay. So it&#x27;s 9 o&#x27;clock. Good morning everyone. We are going to have our first real class for today.

[TRANSCRIPT - 10:52]
And here is the QR code for every session. Um, I will have a corresponding QR code for this session. Or if you have some question, leave your question on slido. Or if you have some question in the end, we will also have one minute.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide displays a list of &quot;Satellite Schools&quot; with their corresponding names in Chinese and English. The list includes: Chaoyang University of Technology, Tatung University, National United University, Taipei Medical University, National Open University, National Central University, Providence University, National Sun Yat-sen University, Shih Chien University, Feng Chia University, and National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology.

[TRANSCRIPT - 11:13]
So then before we start, there is something to let you know. <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">For the people who are on the YouTube, if you are belong to those school, Chaoyang University of Technology, Tatung University, National United University, Taipei Medical University, National Open University, National Central University, Providence University, National Sun Yat-sen University, Shih Chien University, Feng Chia University, National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology. If you belong to this school, your school has satellites course.</span>

[TRANSCRIPT - 11:40]
On the NTU cool, one is our main course. So which means you are going to have two course on NTU cool. One is our main course, one is for your school.

[TRANSCRIPT - 11:50]
So for those student, you did not see your school&#x27;s name on it, which means you directly take the course with it. We actually will give you the grade, and then all the question will come to us. If you come from the satellite school, you can also ask question to our TA. But supposedly in your school you have your corresponding TA in your school. So pay attention to your NTU cool.

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
The slide shows a table titled &quot;Pending Invitation from NTU Cool&quot;. It lists several names (Arthur, Bastian, Tobias, Cedric, THI TO NGA) with their Login IDs, SEI IDs, Sections, and Roles (Student or Auditor). Some entries are marked as &#x27;pending&#x27;. To the right of the table, there are statistics for three universities: National Tsing Hua University (59 Pending Enrollments, 90 Active Enrollments), National Cheng Kung University (11 Pending Enrollments, 23 Active Enrollments), and National Sun Yat-sen University (10 Pending Enrollments, 19 Active Enrollments).

[TRANSCRIPT - 12:22]
And then this one is what I checked last night. Last night when I checked the NTU cool, I find out <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">we still have 300 student haven&#x27;t accept our invitation from NTU cool.</span>

[TRANSCRIPT - 12:38]
And then let me try to sample some school. So for example, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">from National Tsing Hua University, we still have around 60 student are not accept the invitation.</span>

[TRANSCRIPT - 12:50]
to the email you left in our school system. NTU cool send you the invitation email to the email you left in our school system.
